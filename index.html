    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Melisha Thapa. I am currently in my second year of 
        BSc (Hons) Computer Science at Biratnagar International College.
        I have always been passionate about technology and the endless possibilities 
        it offers to solve real-world problems.
        <br><br>
        I am still at the beginning of my programming journey, but I have developed 
        a strong interest in web development. I have a foundational understanding of 
        HTML and I am excited to continue improving my skills in CSS, JavaScript, and 
        many other areas in the future.
